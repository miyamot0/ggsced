\usage{
ggsced_style_y(expansion = 0, lwd = 2, col = "black")
}
\arguments{
\item{expansion}{Percentage of axis to pad (top/bottom) to break axis (Note: normalized parent units)}

\item{lwd}{Width of axis line}

\item{col}{Color of axis drawn (default = 'black')}
}
\value{
Annotation to simulate a disconnected y-axis via expansion
}
\description{
This is a convenience element designed to support a more complete interpretation of SCED-specific style conventions through ggplot. Specifically, an axis is drawn with a specific manner of expansion to support the broken axis (i.e., non-connected x/y) expected of SCED-specific publication guidelines.
