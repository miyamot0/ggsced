Description: Provides specialized visualization tools for Single-Case Experimental Design (SCED) 
    research using 'ggplot2'. SCED studies are a crucial methodology in behavioral and 
    educational research where individual participants serve as their own controls through 
    carefully designed experimental phases. This package extends 'ggplot2' to create 
    publication-ready graphics with professional phase change lines, support for multiple 
    baseline designs, and styling functions that follow SCED visualization conventions. 
    Key functions include adding phase change demarcation lines to existing plots and 
    formatting axes with broken axis appearance commonly used in single-case research.
